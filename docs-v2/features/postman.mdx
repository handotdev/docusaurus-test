Fern has a first class integration with Postman so that you can automatically
update your Postman collection any time you generate code.

## Configure the Postman Integration

**Step 1**: Login to Postman and then select an existing Workspace, or create a
new one.

**Step 2**: Get your workspace ID. To view the workspace ID, select the
information icon Information icon. It will look something like
`3b2d99e8-138f-49da-8658-2b47e326g192`. Save this as an environment variable,
such as \{POSTMAN_WORKSPACE_ID\}

**Step 3**: Generate a Postman API key
[here](https://go.postman.co/settings/me/api-keys). Save this as an enviroment
variable, such as \{POSTMAN_API_KEY\}.

**Step 4**: Add the

```yml /fern/api/generators.yml
draft:
  - name: fernapi/fern-postman
    version: 0.0.xx
    mode: download-files
    output-path: ./generated-postman
? +   config
? +     publishing
+       apiKey: ${POSTMAN_API_KEY}
+       workspaceId: ${POSTMAN_WORKSPACE_ID}
```
