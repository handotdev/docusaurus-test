## Setting up Fern in your repo

### Install

In terminal, run

```bash
npm install -g fern-api
```

### Initialize

In the root of your repo, run `fern init`. This will create the following folder
structure in your project:

```
fern/
├─ fern.config.json # root-level configuration
└─ api/ # your API
  ├─ generators.yml # generators you're using
  └─ definition/
    ├─ api.yml  # API-level configuration
    └─ imdb.yml # endpoints, types, and errors

```

### Defining your API

Your **Fern Definition** is a set of YAML files that are the single source of
truth for your API. You check your **Fern Definition** into your repo, inside of
which describes your API requests, responses, model, paths, methods, errors, and
authentication scheme.

Check out
[an example Fern Definition](https://github.com/fern-api/fern-examples/blob/main/fern/api/definition/movie.yml)

### Generate code

Fern's code generators run remotely in the cloud. The input is your **Fern
Definition** and the output is auto-generated code. You configure which
generators you're using in [generators.yml](/cli/generate).

Check out
[an example generators.yml](https://github.com/fern-api/fern-examples/blob/main/fern/api/generators.yml)
on Github.
