  "Endpoints can throw errors on failure. An endpoint can have multiple errors."

Errors have the following properties:

- **body**: a name
- **status code**: a server response to a browserâ€™s request (optional)
- **type(s)**: information about the error that the client can expect (optional)

## Example of using errors

The `getMovie` endpoint below has two errors that can throw: `NotFoundError` and
`UnauthorizedError`.

```yml
services:
  http:
    MoviesService:
      auth: false
      base-path: /movies
      endpoints:
        getMovie:
          method: GET
          path: /{movieId}
          path-parameters:
            movieId: MovieId
          response:
            ok: Movie
            failed:
              errors:
                - NotFoundError
                - UnauthorizedError
errors:
  NotFoundError:
    http:
      statusCode: 404
    type:
      properties:
        id: MovieId
  UnauthorizedError:
    http:
      statusCode: 401
    type:
      properties:
        message: string
```

Let's say that a client hits the `getMovie` endpoint looking for _Iron Man 5_.
That movie doesn't exist in IMDb, so the server would throw a `NotFoundError`.
The response would be:

```json
{
  "_error": "NotFoundError",
  "_errorInstanceId": "67d92c10-b094-49b2-8ea4-0b84013ad1bc",
  "MovieId": "Iron Man 5"
}
```

By providing the `MovieId` the frontend can now display a string to the user:
_"No results found for "Iron Man 5"_.

## Forward compatiblility

Errors are forward compatibile; you can add errors as you go without breaking
clients.

## Error instance ids

When an error is encountered, an `errorInstanceId` is generated automatically
and can be logged, making debugging easier.
