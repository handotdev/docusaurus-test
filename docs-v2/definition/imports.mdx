## Example of using imports

Let's say that we've got a `movies.yml` where we've already defined a `MovieId`.

```yml movies.yml
types:
  MovieId: string
```

We now want to create a new file called `actors.yml` that includes every movie
an Actor has had a role in. We don't want to redefine `MovieId`, instead we want
to reference what we already defined above. We can accomplish this by using an
import.

```yml actors.yml
imports:
  movies: movies.yml

types:
  ActorId: string

  Actor:
    properties:
      id: ActorId
      name: string
      movies: list<movies.MovieId>
```

In the last line above, `movies.` informs which import to reference and
`MovieId` is the id that we're referencing. While this example shows importing a
type from another file, you can also import errors.
