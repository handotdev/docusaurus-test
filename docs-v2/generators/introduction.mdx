## How code generation works

A code generator reads in your **Fern Definition** and outputs code. The
outputted code is either published to a registry or downloaded locally within
your project. Code generators run remotely in the cloud.

By default, `generators.yml` starts with two empty lists: `draft` and `release`.

```yml /fern/api/generators.yml
draft: []
release: []
```

**Draft** is used when iterating on your API and SDKs.

**Release** is used when you are ready to share your SDKs with the world.

## An example of generators.md

View an example using multiple generators
[on Github](https://github.com/fern-api/fern-examples/blob/main/fern/api/generators.yml)
or here:

```yml /fern/api/generators.yml
draft:
  - name: fernapi/fern-java
    version: 0.0.115
    mode: publish
  - name: fernapi/fern-openapi
    version: 0.0.8
    config:
      format: yaml
    mode: download-files
    output-path: ./generated-openapi

release:
  - name: fernapi/fern-typescript-sdk
    version: 0.0.215
    publishing:
      npm:
        package-name: "@fern-api/example"
        token: ${NPM_TOKEN}
    github:
      repository: fern-api/example-node
  - name: fernapi/fern-java-sdk
    version: 0.0.117
    publishing:
      maven:
        coordinate: "io.github.fern-api:example"
    github:
      repository: fern-api/example-java-sdk
```

## Draft

Generators in the `draft` list will publish to a private registry managed by
Fern. Use this when your API is a work-in-progress. By default, code generators
you add will show up as a draft.

[Add a generator](../cli/add.md) in the CLI. For example, when we add the
`postman` generator:

```yml /fern/api/generators.yml
draft:
+ - name: fernapi/fern-typescript-sdk
+   version: 0.0.206
+   mode: download-files
release: []
```

## Release

Generators in the `release` list will publish to a public registry (e.g. npm,
Maven, PyPi). Use this when your API is ready for release. You will need to add
additional configuration within each generator to tell Fern where to publish.

For example:

```yml /fern/api/generators.yml
draft: []
release:
  - name: fernapi/fern-java-sdk
    version: 0.0.xxx
    mode: publish
? +   outputs
? +     maven
+       url: https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/
+       coordinate: <maven-group:maven-artifact>
+       username: ${MAVEN_USERNAME}
+       password: ${MAVEN_PASSWORD}
```
